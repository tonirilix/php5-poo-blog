This is a really really old code that I did just to try to implement OOP in PHP.
As you can see the code it's not MVC because I was not aware of it.

It has kind of an API wich it was a really good idea since I was able to separete the working flow into Frontend and Backend.

Implements the class EyeSecureSession wich uses cast128 to manage secure session.
